## Description

A while back at CCN Company, I faced a challenge. I needed to gather crucial information from our PROD applications about Custom Declaration status in the TradeNet Application at CCN Companies. The catch was that I lacked direct database access since I was new, relying instead on our internal web application for status updates.
In response, I came up with a solution. I developed a web scraping application. This tool allowed me to extract the required status information and promptly send it to our team via Telegram alerts. This help me to get latest information when there is issue with declaration status.

The application's journey didn't stop there. It now handles diverse sources like SFTP folders and SQL Server databases too.
This experience refined my technical skills and deepened my understanding of web scraping, Telegram API, data processing, and integrating various data sources.
